# 🎨 HTML Email Fix - Convert from Plain Text to Beautiful HTML

## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Your emails are being sent as **plain text** instead of the beautiful HTML template you created. This is because the Google Apps Script is using `MailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body)` which only sends plain text.

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Fixed
- ✅ Updated `sendWelcomeEmailViaGmail()` function to send HTML emails
- ✅ Added complete HTML template with CSS styling
- ✅ Included plain text fallback for compatibility
- ✅ Added proper first name personalization

### Technical Changes Made
1. **Changed from:** `MailApp.sendEmail(data.email, subject, body)`
2. **Changed to:** `MailApp.sendEmail({ to: data.email, subject: subject, htmlBody: htmlBody, body: plainTextBody })`

### Email Features Now Include
- 🎨 **Professional HTML Design** with CSS styling
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** layout
- 🎯 **Brand Colors** matching your solar theme
- ✨ **Styled Buttons** for call-to-action
- 📝 **Highlighted Sections** for important information
- 🏷️ **First Name Personalization** (Dear Sarah, instead of Dear Sarah Johnson)

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Update Your Google Apps Script

### Instructions for Deployment:

1. **Open Google Apps Script**: Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)

2. **Open Your Project**: Find your existing "Solar Form Handler" project

3. **Replace the Function**: Look for the `sendWelcomeEmailViaGmail()` function and replace it with the updated version from `google-apps-script-fixed.js`

4. **Save & Deploy**: Save the project and redeploy the web app if prompted

### Test the Fix:
1. Submit a test form with your email address
2. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
3. You should now receive a **beautifully formatted HTML email** instead of plain text
